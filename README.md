# Employee Productivity & Workload Analytics Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes employee productivity and workload patterns to identify under-utilization and overwork risks.  
It uses Python for data analysis and Power BI for interactive dashboard visualization to support workforce planning decisions.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Organizations often struggle to measure productivity effectively using working hours alone.  
This project aims to evaluate workforce efficiency by combining output, workload, and performance indicators.

## 📊 Dataset
Public employee productivity dataset containing:
- Employee details
- Weekly hours worked
- Projects completed
- Performance ratings

Additional productivity metrics and risk categories were engineered during analysis.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Power BI
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Key Analysis
- Created productivity score based on output per working hour
- Identified under-utilized and overworked employees
- Analyzed productivity trends by department and performance rating

## 📈 Dashboard Features
- KPIs for total employees, average productivity, and workload
- Productivity risk distribution
- Department-wise productivity analysis
- Interactive filters for department and risk category
